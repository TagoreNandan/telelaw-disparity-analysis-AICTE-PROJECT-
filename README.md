Problem Statement 37: Analyzing Demographic and Regional Disparities in Tele-
Law Case Registrations for Inclusive Legal Access
Despite the expansion of the Tele-Law initiative across states and districts, there is
limited understanding of demographic utilization patterns and regional disparities in
legal aid access. The challenge is to analyze Tele-Law case registration data to uncover
gender-wise, caste-wise, and geographic disparities in service utilization across CSCs.
Uneven representation among marginalized groups (SC, ST, OBC) and low outreach in
certain districts raise concerns about equity and effectiveness. Moreover, the varying
number of CSCs per region complicates direct comparisons. This problem demands a
data-driven approach to evaluate inclusivity and optimize service delivery.
